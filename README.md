- In Notion, open the Calendar you want to import into.
- Drag and drop the `feed.ics` file into the Notion calendar page.
- Notion will automatically import all the events and tasks into your calendar view.

## üìù Notes

- The `.ics` file does **NOT AUTO-UPDATE**. If your class schedule changes, you'll need to repeat this process. For live updates, sync the `.ics` URL to Google Calendar and embed it into Notion.
- You can also paste the URL from Step 4 into apps like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar for live syncing.

üéâ You're done! Your Brightspace schedule is now available in Notion.
